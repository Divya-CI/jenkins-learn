//name: The name of the project

//description: A brief description of the project
//main: The entry point for the project (i.e., the file that will be executed when the project is started)
//scripts: A collection of scripts that can be executed from the command line using the npm run command. In this example, there are three scripts defined: start, test, and build.
//dependencies: A list of dependencies that the project requires to run in production. In this example, the project depends on the express and lodash packages.
//devDependencies: A list of dependencies that the project requires to run in development. In this example, the project depends on the mocha, chai, and webpack packages.
//The package.json file is an important file in Node.js projects because it provides a standardized way to manage dependencies, configure the project, and execute scripts. 
//It is typically used in conjunction with the npm command-line tool to manage the project's dependencies and run various tasks, such as running tests, building the project, and starting the server.
